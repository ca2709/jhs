     The library media program at JHS seeks to support the goal of the Jefferson City Board of Education to promote excellence in all areas. The media center seeks to be an educational environment with learning opportunities that foster intellectual, physical, social, and emotional development that closely aligns with each students’ unique blend of aptitudes, achievements, needs, learning styles and interests. <br><br>
    The Jefferson High School Library serves as the hub of the school, where students and teachers gather to teach, learn, problem solve and create.  It is a place where all students, teachers and faculty are welcome to express their ideas, investigate unanswered questions, collaborate with peers, and to engage in learning.  It is a safe place for the school community at JHS.
